### Mage Head

+   __Casting Time:__ 1 Action
+   __Range:__ 30 feet
+   __Components:__ V,S
+   __Duration:__ 1 minute
+   __Explanation:__

    A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

    You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it. The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

### Prestidigitation

+   __Casting Time:__ 1 action 
+   __Range:__ 10 feet
+   __Components:__ V, S
+   __Duration:__  Up to 1 hour
+   __Explanation:__

    This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spell-casters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

    +   You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
    +   You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
    +   You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
    +   You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
    +   You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
    +   You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

    If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

### Fire Bolt

+   __Casting Time:__ 1 Action
+   __Range:__ 	120 feet
+   __Components:__ V, S
+   __Duration:__ Instantaneous
+   __Explanation:__

    You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1D10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

+   __At Higher Levels:__ This spell's damage increases by 1D10 when you reach 5th level (2D10), 11th level (3D10), and 17th level (4D10).


### Minor Illusion

+   __Casting Time:__ 1 Action
+   __Range:__ 30 Feet
+   __Components:__ S, M (a bit of fleece)
+   __Duration:__ 1 Minute
+   __Explanation:__

    You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast the spell again.

    If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

    If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the object reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

    If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell DC. If the creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

## Level 1

### Color Spray

+   __Casting Time:__ 1 action
+   __Range:__ Self (15-foot cone)
+   __Components:__ V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)
+   __Duration:__ 1 Round
+   __Explanation:__

	A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can't see).

	Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the spell ends. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

+   __At Higher Levels:__ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.


### Longstrider

+   __Casting Time:__ 1 action
+   __Range:__ Touch
+   __Components:__ V, S, M (a pinch of dirt)
+   __Duration:__ 1 hour
+   __Explanation:__

	You touch a creature. The target’s speed increases by 10 feet until the spell ends.

+   __At Higher Levels:__ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.


### Mage Armor

+   __Casting Time:__ 1 action
+   __Range:__ Touch
+   __Components:__ V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)
+   __Duration:__ 8 hours
+   __Explanation:__

	You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

+   __At Higher Levels:__


### Protection from Evil and Good

+   __Casting Time:__ 1 action
+   __Range:__ Touch
+   __Components:__ V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)
+   __Duration:__ Concentration up to 10 minutes
+   __Explanation:__

	Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw
    against the relevant effect.
+   __At Higher Levels:__


### Ray of Sickness

+   __Casting Time:__ 1 action 
+   __Range:__ 60 feet
+   __Components:__ V, S
+   __Duration:__ Instantaneous
+   __Explanation:__

	A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.

+   __At Higher Levels:__ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
