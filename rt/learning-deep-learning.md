## Introduction

This reading list is an on-going personal challenge I'm about to start again.
The challenge is to digest one paper a day in the morning (a.k.a eating a paper
as breakfast). Over time I found that one can really really read a lot in
an hour. And it's a perfect way of starting a new day with some new interesting
knowledge.

In general, 

The old version of this post is now hosted at [here](/learning-deep-learning-backup).
I will preserve this legacy version only for lookup reasons.

## For Novice

_If you have no idea about Machine Learning and Scientific Computing, I suggest you learn the following materials while you are reading Machine Learning or Deep Learning books. You don't have to master these materials, but a basic understanding is essential. It's hard to open a meaningful conversation if the person has no idea about matrix or single variable calculus._

## Literature in Deep Learning and Feature Learning

_Deep Learning is a fast-moving community. Therefore the line between "Recent Advances" and "Literature that matter" is kind of blurred. Here I collected articles that are either introducing fundamental algorithms, techniques or highly cited by the community._
